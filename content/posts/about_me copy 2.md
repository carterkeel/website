# From Content Creation to Cybersecurity
---

My name is Carter Keel. I am originally from both Florida and California, where my family moved when I was young to start a church. I was homeschooled for nine years while living in San Francisco, where I developed a curiosity for different places and a love for trying new things.

In 2019, I moved back to Florida and began pursuing content creation, launching my channel _Random but Cool_. Through this project, I refined my skills as a storyteller and video editor, eventually gaining clients for editing work. While in high school, I earned both my high school diploma and an Associate in Arts degree through dual enrollment.

My production experience grew further through wedding videography, livestream switching, and managing media at multiple churches. After graduating high school, I enrolled at the University of West Florida to pursue a bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity, completing rigorous coursework in networking and coding. In the summer of 2025, I built and launched a personal website showcasing my projects and social platforms.

Today, my passion for technology continues to grow. I’ve rebranded my channel to focus on tech education, helping thousands of people stay safe online. I also specialize in building home servers and repurposing old hardware, combining sustainability with innovation.
