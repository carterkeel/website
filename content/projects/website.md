This website is a passion project to showcase my technical computer skills. Building it required reading documentation, using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and using [Cloudflare](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) to host this static site.

My portfolio website uses the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/) to generate a static website (no connected database). This is extremely helpful for creating posts like this because I can simply use the Markdown markup language to write all my content. I can do this in several ways for example, using an editor like Obsidian or a content management system like Sveltia.

My favorite part about my site is that, since it is static, I can have it hosted on [Cloudflare](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) completely free, only needing a domain to clean up the URL.

If you are even slightly considering making your own website, I would highly recommend [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) because of the sheer modularity of the framework. My personal website is entirely modifiable through a simple `.yaml` file, meaning I don’t even have to touch the HTML to change details. I talk more about the value of creating a website and how to host it for free in the following video. (This is a legacy version of my website, but the points still stand, and the Cloudflare info is still valuable.)
