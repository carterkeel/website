I have consistently published videos to my YouTube channel, [**@RandomButCool**](https://www.youtube.com/@RandomButCool), and other social media accounts since 2019, educating over 1 million viewers per month across all platforms. My videos cover everything IT and cybersecurity related, showcasing projects, best practices, and how to stay safe online. One of my most viewed videos features me terminating Ethernet cables so I could have custom lengths for my homelab.

Other content I create is more technical, such as use cases for VLANs and virtual machines. I also enjoy educating viewers on the value of self-hosting apps and highlighting great digital tools that make your computer work for you. I’m very proud of my channel and the value it brings feel free to drop a comment on this article or on any of my videos.
