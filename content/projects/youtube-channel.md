## Random But Cool Overview

I have consistently published videos to my YouTube channel, @RandomButCool, and other social media accounts since 2019, educating over 1 million viewers per month across all platforms. My videos cover everything IT and cybersecurity-related, showcasing projects, best practices, and how to stay safe online. One of my most viewed videos features me terminating Ethernet cables so I could have custom lengths for my homelab.

Other content I create is more technical, such as use cases for VLANs and virtual machines. I also enjoy educating viewers on the value of self-hosting apps and highlighting great digital tools that make your computer work for you. I’m very proud of my channel and the value it brings—feel free to drop a comment on this article or on any of my videos.
