<hr>
<p>My name is Carter Keel. I am originally from both Florida and California, where my family moved when I was young to start a church. I was homeschooled for nine years while living in San Francisco, where I developed a curiosity for different places and a love for trying new things.</p>
<p>In 2019, I moved back to Florida and began pursuing content creation, launching my channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RandomButCool">Random But Cool</a>. Through this project, I refined my skills as a storyteller and video editor, eventually gaining clients for editing work. While in high school, I earned both my high school diploma and an Associate in Arts degree through dual enrollment.</p>
<p>My production experience grew further through wedding videography, livestream switching, and managing media at multiple churches. After graduating high school, I enrolled at the University of West Florida to pursue a bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity, completing rigorous coursework in networking and coding. In the summer of 2025, I built and launched a personal website showcasing my projects and social platforms.</p>
<p>Today, my passion for technology continues to grow. I’ve rebranded my channel to focus on tech education, helping thousands of people stay safe online. I also specialize in building home servers and repurposing old hardware, combining sustainability with innovation.</p>
