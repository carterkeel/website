      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;from-content-creation-to-cybersecurity&#34;&gt;From Content Creation to Cybersecurity&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My name is Carter Keel. I am originally from both Florida and California, where my family moved when I was young to start a church. I was homeschooled for nine years while living in San Francisco, where I developed a curiosity for different places and a love for trying new things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, I moved back to Florida and began pursuing content creation, launching my channel &lt;em&gt;Random but Cool&lt;/em&gt;. Through this project, I refined my skills as a storyteller and video editor, eventually gaining clients for editing work. While in high school, I earned both my high school diploma and an Associate in Arts degree through dual enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
