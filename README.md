# Hugo Static Site Template

This is a simple, lightweight static website built with **HTML and CSS**, powered by the **Hugo** static site generator.

I designed this site as a **reusable template**, so feel free to use it as a starting point for your own project, tweak it, or learn from how it’s put together.

The website is very much a **work in progress** and is continually evolving as I refine the design, structure, and features over time. Improvements and experiments happen regularly.

You’re welcome to download the project, explore the source code, and adapt it to your needs.

## Features
