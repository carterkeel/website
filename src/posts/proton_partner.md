# I Am Now A Proton Partner
---
I’ve used Proton products for a few years, and I can never go back to Google.  
Their VPN has a strong no-logs policy, and they don’t have to give in to government demands because they’re based in Switzerland, which is a privacy-oriented country at least in the digital space.

I only recommend products I would suggest to my friends; in fact, many of them used Proton even before I partnered with them.

I’m super excited for Proton to be my first affiliate partnership, and I would highly recommend their products—especially their VPN.
