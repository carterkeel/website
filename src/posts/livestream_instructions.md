## 5. OBS Studio Configuration
- Open OBS Studio on the Windows computer.
- Ensure Studio Mode (on the right side) is enabled — it should be highlighted in blue.

- The Preview window (left) is used to prepare the next scene.
- To switch scenes, click Transition.

### Troubleshooting Video Inputs
- If the Message and Slides scenes appear reversed, swap the two USB-A cables based on the order they plug into the USB-C hub.
- Only use the Music scene while music is playing. Note that music-only lyrics may cover people; adjust zoom to prevent this.
- The Slides scene displays what appears on the Mac and the projector.

## 6. YouTube Studio Setup
- After OBS is configured, open the Waterfox browser.
- Open a new tab and navigate to YouTube Studio using the livestream bookmark.
- Edit the livestream title to include the date of the service.
- Update the episode number to one higher than the previous stream.

### Starting the Stream
- When the projector displays the countdown timer, click Start Streaming and Start Recording in OBS.
- Ensure the timer appears in the Program window.
- Make sure the band is fully visible during worship and that Jimmy is fully visible while preaching.
- Refer to past livestreams for visual framing guidance.

## 7. Teardown
- Once the stream is finished, power down all equipment.
- Remove all cables, store everything neatly, and return all equipment to the closet.
